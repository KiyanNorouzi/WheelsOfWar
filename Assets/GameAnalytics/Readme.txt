A GameAnalytics menu has been added under Window in
the menu bar.

Create a GameAnalytics Settings resource by going to:
Window > GameAnalytics > Select Settings

The Settings resource allows you to create an account,
studio and game, login to get your game key and secret
key, and setup Custom Dimensions, Resource Types, and
other advanced settings.
